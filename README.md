# ZombieHuntingGame
My university graduation project. A HyberCasual mobile game that can run on Android using the 3D Unity editor and the C# language. <br> <br>
This project aims to develop a 3D mobile Android game in the HyberCasual genre and aims to provide a comprehensive gaming experience that includes game dynamics, visual aesthetics (User Interface-UI), and sound design (Music, AudioSource, AudioClip). <br><br>
In the game, players control a police character who is pursued by zombie characters while trying to overcome the obstacles they encounter as they progress through various levels. This tracking mechanism has been successfully integrated using Unity's powerful NavMeshAgent component. Level advancements, difficulty increases, and player progress are stored and managed using the PlayerPrefs system, so players can pick up where they left off after launching the game. <br><br>
In terms of visual aesthetics, Unity's Material and Animation (Run, Walk) (Animation.Animator) systems have been actively used. Characters and animations obtained from the Asset Store have been integrated into various components of the game, increasing the visual quality of the game. In the design of the obstacles, original designs were created using Unity's 3D object creation and editing tools. <br><br>
In order to strengthen the atmosphere of the game, sound effects and music suitable for various events and situations have been added. This aims to provide players with a more immersive and engaging experience. <br><br>
Ultimately, this project aims to create a fun, addictive and constantly engaging mobile gaming experience using Unity's comprehensive game development tools and technologies. <br> <hr>
